docker-openstack
================

Run OpenStack Havana in a Docker container.
Includes Keystone, Nova Controller, Glance, Dashboard, MySQL, Apache, and RabbitMQ 

Nova-Compute is setup for provisioning Docker images only. 
Details here http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/config-reference/content/docker.html

#### Prepare Vagrant
If you're using the offical Docker Vagrantfile to run Docker then you must `export FORWARD_DOCKER_PORTS=1` to forward all ports in the 49xxx range.

#### Start OpenStack container
After building the image using the `build` script, use `shell` script to launch OpenStack inside Docker.

#### Start OpenStack Services
Run ```supervisord&``` to start all OpenStack Services.

#### Docker in Docker
You now have Docker running inside Docker.  
The `docker ps` command will show that the Docker Registry is running in a container too.
Run the `install-ubuntu-image.sh` script to pull the `ubuntu` image into your local Registry.

#### Using Horizon
1. Point your browser to `http://localhost:49802/horizon`
2. You will now be able to launch Docker containers inside OpenStack!

#### Heat
Heat has been configured with the additional Docker plugin as described here. https://github.com/dotcloud/openstack-heat-docker

That means Heat can create stacks directly with Docker instead of Nova.  I'm still getting some errors with the wordpress example.
